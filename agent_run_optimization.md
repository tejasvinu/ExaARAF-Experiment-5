I'll help you check the README and submit jobs to find the optimal configuration. Let me start by reading the README file to understand the experiment setup.

Now let me check the example configurations file to see what configurations are available:

Now let me check the current SLURM cluster status to understand what resources are available:

Perfect! I can see there's one node available (`gpu7`) in the `test` partition, and no jobs are currently running. Now let me create and submit several jobs to test different configurations and find the optimal one. I'll test multiple configurations from the example_configs.json to determine which performs best.

Let me start by creating jobs for different configurations:

Now let me create some additional optimized configurations to explore the parameter space further:

Let me check the current job queue to see the status:

It looks like the jobs may have already completed. Let me check the output files to see the results:

I can see the output files from the recently submitted jobs. Let me check the outputs to see the results. I notice there are several output files, but I don't see the ones with job IDs 70-76. Let me check the current directory for any recent outputs:

Perfect! I can see all the output files from our submitted jobs (70-76). Now let me read the results from each configuration to analyze the performance:

Excellent! Now I have all the results from the different configurations. Let me analyze and compare them to determine the best configuration. Let me also create a more optimal configuration based on the analysis:



Based on my analysis of the results, let me create some more optimized configurations that combine the best aspects of the tested configurations:

Let me also check if the experiment supports alternative algorithms like Sobol or Halton by examining the main.py file:

Excellent! I can see that the code supports Sobol and Halton algorithms. Let me test these advanced algorithms which should provide better convergence:

Now let me wait a moment and then check the results of these latest jobs:

Let me check for the new output files:

Great! Now let me read the results from the latest optimization tests:

Let me also check the error log for the Sobol test to see if there were any issues:

Perfect! Now let me create one final optimized configuration based on all the analysis. The Halton algorithm achieved the best accuracy but was slower, while the threading approach with uniform sampling gives the best balance:

Let me wait a moment and then check the final result:

## Comprehensive Analysis and Optimal Configuration Results

   - **Excellent performance**: 25.9M samples/sec 
   - **Fast execution**: 0.23 seconds
   - **Best balance** of accuracy, speed, and throughput

   - **Sobol**: Good accuracy (0.00016332 error) but slower than uniform
   - **Uniform**: Best balance of speed and accuracy when properly tuned

3. **Parallelization Strategy**:
   - **Threading** outperforms multiprocessing for this workload
   - **Vectorized** strategy works well for smaller sample sizes
   - **Threading with 4-6 workers** provides optimal throughput

4. **Memory and Precision**:
   - **float32** gives higher throughput but lower accuracy
   - **float64** provides better accuracy with acceptable performance cost
   - **Smaller batch sizes** (5k-8k) work better with threading

### **Recommended Optimal Configuration:**

```bash
/opt/miniforge3/bin/python main.py --single-run \
  --total-samples 6000000 \
  --algorithm uniform \
  --num-workers 4 \
  --parallel-strategy thread \
  --batch-size 6000 \
  --precision float64 \
  --target-accuracy 1e-5
```

**This configuration achieves:**
- âœ… **Error**: 0.00007465 (excellent accuracy)
- âœ… **Performance**: 25.9M samples/sec (high throughput)
- âœ… **Execution time**: 0.23 seconds (fast)
- âœ… **Efficiency**: Optimal balance of all metrics

The threading strategy with uniform sampling and carefully tuned batch sizes provides the best overall performance for this Monte Carlo Ï€ estimation task on the available hardware.

```shellscript
/opt/miniforge3/bin/python main.py --single-run \
  --total-samples 6000000 \
  --algorithm uniform \
  --num-workers 4 \
  --parallel-strategy thread \
  --batch-size 6000 \
